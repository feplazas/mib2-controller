## Introduction

Felipe Plazas ("Developer", "we", "us", or "our") operates the MIB2 Controller mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App.

## Information Collection and Use

### Data We Do NOT Collect

- Location data
- Device identifiers or advertising IDs
- Usage analytics or behavioral data

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The App stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

2. **App Settings**: Your preferences (language, theme, offline guides) are stored locally using AsyncStorage.
3. **Offline Guides**: Downloaded documentation is cached locally for offline access.

This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third party.

## USB Device Access

The App requires USB Host permission to communicate with compatible USB adapters. This permission is used exclusively for:

## Data Security

All data remains on your device. We implement appropriate technical measures within the App to protect locally stored data, including:

- MD5 and SHA256 checksum verification for backup integrity

## Children's Privacy

Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Last Updated" date.

## Your Rights
