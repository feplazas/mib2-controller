## 1. Legal Context: The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 is the U.S. federal legislation that implements the WIPO Copyright Treaty and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaties[1]. Section 1201(a)(1) of Title 17 of the United States Code establishes that no person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under copyright[2]. This provision was designed to protect technological protection measures (TPMs) that copyright holders use to control access to their digital works.

However, Congress recognized that an absolute prohibition could prevent legitimate and non-infringing uses of protected works. Therefore, Section 1201(a)(1) includes a "fail-safe" mechanism that requires the Librarian of Congress, following a rulemaking process, to publish classes of protected works for which the prohibition on circumvention does not apply during a three-year period[3]. This triennial process allows the legal framework to adapt to technological realities and user needs.

## 2. Historic Decision by the Librarian of Congress (2015)

On October 27, 2015, the Librarian of Congress issued a historic decision granting vehicle owners the legal right to access and modify the computer software that controls the operating systems in their vehicles[4]. This decision was adopted following an extensive rulemaking process conducted by the Register of Copyrights, which included public comments, hearings, and consultations with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

The Librarian of Congress's decision was published in the Federal Register on October 28, 2015, with immediate effective date[5]. This final rule establishes exemptions to the prohibition on circumvention contained in Section 1201(a)(1) of the DMCA, allowing vehicle owners and other authorized persons to access the software embedded in their vehicles for specific and legitimate purposes.

The Center for Auto Safety, an independent consumer advocacy organization, issued a statement celebrating the decision. Clarence Ditlow, Executive Director of the Center for Auto Safety, stated:

> "In an effort to monopolize the multi-billion dollar auto repair business, auto makers have copyrighted the software in vehicles computers and used lockdown devices known as Technological Protection Measures (TPM's) to block consumer access to the computer code under an obscure law known as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Today the Librarian of Congress issued a historic decision giving vehicle owners the right to access and modify the computer software that controls the operating systems in their vehicles."[4]

This statement underscores the economic and public policy context that motivated the exemption. Automobile manufacturers had used software copyright and TPMs to restrict vehicle owners' access to the software in their own vehicles, effectively creating a monopoly over the repair and maintenance market.

## 3. DMCA Exemption Class 21: Vehicle Software for Diagnosis, Repair, or Modification

The most relevant exemption for MIB2 Controller is **Class 21**, which specifically covers vehicle software. The official text of the exemption, as it appears in the Federal Register, states:

> "Computer programs that are contained in and control the functioning of a motorized land vehicle such as a personal automobile, commercial motor vehicle or mechanized agricultural vehicle, when circumvention is a necessary step undertaken by the authorized owner of the vehicle to allow the diagnosis, repair or lawful modification of a vehicle function; and where such circumvention does not constitute a violation of applicable law, and provided, however, that such circumvention is initiated no earlier than 12 months after the effective date of this regulation."[6]

This exemption contains several key elements that define its scope and applicability:

| **Element** | **Description** | **Application to MIB2 Controller** |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Computer programs contained in vehicles** | Embedded software that controls the functioning of motorized land vehicles | MIB2 software is embedded in the Volkswagen vehicle's infotainment unit |
| **Types of vehicles covered** | Personal automobiles, commercial motor vehicles, mechanized agricultural vehicles | Volkswagen vehicles equipped with MIB2 are personal automobiles |
| **Permitted activities** | Diagnosis, repair, or lawful modification of a vehicle function | MIB2 Controller enables diagnosis of the MIB2 unit, reading system information, and modification of infotainment configurations |
| **Necessity requirement** | Circumvention must be a necessary step | Access to MIB2 software requires circumventing TPMs implemented by the manufacturer |
| **Authorized owner** | Must be undertaken by the authorized owner of the vehicle | The application is designed for exclusive use by the vehicle owner |
| **No violation of applicable laws** | Circumvention must not constitute a violation of other laws | MIB2 Controller does not facilitate violations of the Clean Air Act or the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (see Section 5) |
| **Waiting period** | No earlier than 12 months after October 28, 2015 | The exemption has been in effect since October 2016 and has been renewed in triennial cycles (2018, 2021, 2024) |

Class 21 exemption has been consistently renewed in each subsequent triennial cycle. In 2018, the exemption was expanded to include telematics and entertainment systems[7]. In 2021 and 2024, the exemption was renewed again, confirming the continued recognition of vehicle owners' right to access their vehicles' software[8].

## 4. Legal Limits: What Is NOT Permitted

It is essential to understand that the DMCA Class 21 exemption does not grant an unlimited right to modify any aspect of vehicle software. There are clear legal limits established by other federal laws that protect public safety and the environment.

### 4.1 Clean Air Act: Prohibition on Tampering with Emissions Controls

The Clean Air Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 7522, establishes specific prohibitions against tampering with emissions control devices[9]. Section 7522(a)(3) prohibits:

> "(A) for any person to remove or render inoperative any device or element of design installed on or in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine in compliance with regulations under this subchapter prior to its sale and delivery to the ultimate purchaser, or for any person knowingly to remove or render inoperative any such device or element of design after such sale and delivery to the ultimate purchaser; or
>
> (B) for any person to manufacture or sell, or offer to sell, or install, any part or component intended for use with, or as part of, any motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine, where a principal effect of the part or component is to bypass, defeat, or render inoperative any device or element of design installed on or in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine in compliance with regulations under this subchapter, and where the person knows or should know that such part or component is being offered for sale or installed for such use or put to such use."[9]

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has emphasized enforcement of these prohibitions, establishing civil penalties of up to $4,819 USD per defeat device manufactured, sold, or installed, or per vehicle modified in violation of the Clean Air Act[10]. The EPA has initiated enforcement actions against manufacturers and sellers of aftermarket devices that enable tampering with emissions controls, known as "defeat devices"[11].

### 4.2 National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act: Prohibition on Making Safety Devices Inoperative

The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, codified at 49 U.S.C. § 30122, prohibits making inoperative safety devices installed to comply with federal motor vehicle safety standards[12]. Section 30122(b) states:

> "A manufacturer, distributor, dealer, or motor vehicle repair business may not knowingly make inoperative any part of a device or element of design installed on or in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment in compliance with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter unless the manufacturer, distributor, dealer, or repair business reasonably believes the vehicle or equipment will not be used (except for testing or a similar purpose during maintenance or repair) when the device or element is inoperative."[12]

This prohibition protects critical safety devices such as airbags, anti-lock braking systems (ABS), traction control, automatic emergency braking systems, and other systems designed to prevent accidents or reduce injuries in the event of a collision.

### 4.3 Exclusions from the DMCA Exemption

The DMCA Class 21 exemption originally explicitly excluded software for telematics and entertainment systems. However, this exclusion was removed in the 2018 renewal, expanding the exemption's coverage[7]. Nevertheless, the exemption maintains the fundamental requirement that circumvention must not constitute a violation of applicable laws, which includes the Clean Air Act and the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.

## 5. Specific Analysis of MIB2 Controller

### 5.1 Application Description

MIB2 Controller is an Android mobile application that enables owners of Volkswagen vehicles equipped with MIB2 STD2 Technisat Preh infotainment systems to perform the following functions:

1. **Network and USB connection diagnosis:** The application scans the local network to detect connected MIB2 units and verifies the USB-Ethernet adapter connection.

2. **Telnet connection:** Enables establishing Telnet connections with the MIB2 unit to execute diagnostic and configuration commands.

3. **Device identifier spoofing:** Facilitates modification of USB chipset identifiers for compatibility with the MIB2 unit.

4. **FEC (Feature Enable Codes) generation:** Allows generating codes to enable additional infotainment system features.

5. **Diagnostic tools:** Provides access to system logs, configuration information, and troubleshooting tools.

6. **Language selector:** The application is fully translated into Spanish, English, and German, with live logs that are dynamically translated according to the selected language.

The application includes clear warnings about responsible use and the user's responsibility not to violate other applicable laws.

### 5.2 Nature of the MIB2 System

The MIB2 system (Modular Infotainment Platform, second generation) is an infotainment system developed by Volkswagen Group. This system controls functions such as:

- Radio and media playback
- GPS navigation
- Bluetooth and USB connectivity
- Smartphone integration (Apple CarPlay, Android Auto)
- User preference configuration
- Vehicle information display

**Crucially, the MIB2 system does NOT control critical engine functions, emissions, or vehicle active safety systems.** The MIB2 is an infotainment and connectivity system, separate from the engine's Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and safety systems such as airbags, ABS brakes, and stability control.

### 5.3 Application of DMCA Class 21 Exemption

MIB2 Controller meets all requirements of the DMCA Class 21 exemption:

**Requirement 1: Computer programs contained in motorized land vehicles**

MIB2 software is embedded in the Volkswagen vehicle's infotainment unit, which is a personal automobile (motorized land vehicle). This requirement is met unambiguously.

**Requirement 2: Circumvention as a necessary step**

Access to MIB2 software for diagnostic and modification purposes requires circumventing technological protection measures implemented by Volkswagen. These TPMs include USB device authentication, Telnet access restrictions, and FEC code verification. Without circumventing these measures, the vehicle owner cannot access the software to perform legitimate diagnostics or modifications. Therefore, circumvention is a necessary step.

**Requirement 3: Authorized owner of the vehicle**

MIB2 Controller is designed for exclusive use by the vehicle owner. The application requires physical access to the vehicle and direct connection to the MIB2 unit via a USB-Ethernet adapter. The application does not facilitate unauthorized remote access or use by third parties without the owner's consent.

**Requirement 4: Diagnosis, repair, or lawful modification**

MIB2 Controller's functions clearly fall within the categories of diagnosis and lawful modification:

- **Diagnosis:** The application enables diagnosing the MIB2 unit's status, verifying connectivity, reading system logs, and identifying configuration issues.

- **Lawful modification:** The application enables modifying infotainment system configurations, enabling additional features via FEC codes, and personalizing the user experience. These modifications are lawful because:
  - They do not affect engine control or emissions (Clean Air Act does not apply)
  - They do not affect critical safety devices (National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act does not apply)
  - They are within the scope of infotainment and connectivity functions

**Requirement 5: No violation of applicable laws**

MIB2 Controller does not facilitate or promote violations of the Clean Air Act or the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act:

- **Clean Air Act:** The MIB2 system does not control the engine, fuel injection system, or emissions control devices. Modifications made through MIB2 Controller cannot bypass, defeat, or render inoperative the vehicle's emissions controls.

- **National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act:** The MIB2 system does not control airbags, ABS brakes, traction control, or other active safety systems. Modifications made through MIB2 Controller cannot render these safety devices inoperative.

The application includes a prominent disclaimer that warns:

> "⚠️ Warning: This application allows executing commands directly on the MIB2 unit. Use with caution and only if you know what you are doing. Incorrect commands can damage the system."

This disclaimer places responsibility on the user to use the application responsibly and legally, complying with the exemption's requirement that circumvention must not constitute a violation of applicable laws.

**Requirement 6: Waiting period**

The DMCA Class 21 exemption became effective on October 28, 2015, with a 12-month waiting period, meaning circumvention was permitted starting in October 2016. The exemption has been renewed in the triennial cycles of 2018, 2021, and 2024, confirming its continued validity. MIB2 Controller was developed in 2026, long after the initial waiting period, so this requirement is fully met.

### 5.4 Comparison with Similar Cases

The legality of third-party tools to access and modify vehicle software has been confirmed in multiple contexts:

**Aftermarket diagnostic tools:** The aftermarket diagnostic tools industry (such as OBD-II scanners, ECU reprogramming software, and coding tools) has operated legally under the DMCA exemption since 2015. These tools enable independent repair shops and vehicle owners to access vehicle software for diagnosis and repair[13].

**Vehicle personalization software:** Applications and tools that enable personalizing vehicle configurations (such as BimmerCode for BMW vehicles, OBDeleven for Volkswagen/Audi vehicles, and Forscan for Ford vehicles) operate legally under the same DMCA exemption. These tools enable modifying infotainment, lighting, and other non-critical function configurations[14].

MIB2 Controller is analogous to these established tools and operates within the same legal framework.

## 6. Property Rights and First Sale Doctrine

Beyond the DMCA exemption, vehicle owners' right to access and modify their vehicles' software is grounded in established principles of property law.

### 6.1 Vehicle Ownership vs. Software License

Automobile manufacturers have argued that, although the buyer owns the physical vehicle, the software embedded in the vehicle is subject to a license and is not owned by the buyer[15]. This argument was prominently presented by General Motors in public comments during the 2015 DMCA rulemaking process:

> "Although we currently consider ownership of vehicle software instead of wireless handset software, the law's ambiguity similarly renders it unclear whether consumers 'own' the software embedded in their vehicles or whether they simply have an implied license to operate the vehicle (and the software with it)."[15]

However, this argument was rejected by the Register of Copyrights and the Librarian of Congress in the 2015 decision. The decision recognizes that vehicle owners have substantial rights over the software embedded in their vehicles, regardless of license terms that manufacturers attempt to impose unilaterally.

### 6.2 First Sale Doctrine

The First Sale Doctrine, codified at 17 U.S.C. § 109, establishes that the owner of a particular copy of a copyrighted work may sell or dispose of that copy without the copyright holder's authorization[16]. Although the application of the First Sale Doctrine to embedded software is complex and has been the subject of litigation, the underlying principle is that purchasing a physical product containing software grants the buyer certain rights over that software.

In the vehicle context, the owner purchases the complete vehicle, including all embedded hardware and software. The Librarian of Congress's 2015 decision implicitly recognizes that vehicle owners have sufficient rights over embedded software to justify access for diagnosis, repair, and lawful modification purposes.

---

## 7. Public Policy and Right to Repair

The DMCA Class 21 exemption is framed within a broader "right to repair" movement that seeks to ensure that consumers and independent repair shops can access the tools, parts, and information necessary to repair products they own[17].

### 7.1 Monopolization of the Repair Market

As noted by the Center for Auto Safety, automobile manufacturers have used software copyright and TPMs to create a de facto monopoly over the vehicle repair and maintenance market[4]. By blocking access to vehicle software, manufacturers force owners to go exclusively to authorized dealerships for diagnosis and repair, resulting in significantly higher costs.

The DMCA Class 21 exemption counteracts this monopolization by ensuring that vehicle owners can access their vehicles' software for diagnosis and repair, either by themselves or through independent repair shops. This promotes competition in the repair services market, reduces costs for consumers, and preserves the vehicle owner's freedom of choice.

### 7.2 Innovation and Third-Party Tool Development

The DMCA exemption also fosters innovation by allowing third-party developers to create tools and applications that facilitate access to vehicle software. MIB2 Controller is an example of this innovation. The application provides a user-friendly interface that enables Volkswagen vehicle owners to access diagnostic and configuration functions that would otherwise require expensive specialized equipment or dealership visits.

This innovation benefits consumers by democratizing access to diagnostic and configuration tools, reducing dependence on dealerships, and empowering vehicle owners to maintain and personalize their vehicles according to their preferences.

## 8. Liability and Disclaimers

It is important to note that the DMCA Class 21 exemption does not grant immunity from liability for violations of other laws. If a user of MIB2 Controller uses the application to make modifications that violate the Clean Air Act, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, or other applicable laws, that user may be liable under those laws.

MIB2 Controller addresses this issue through the inclusion of prominent warnings and disclaimers:

1. **Responsible use warning:** The application warns users that they must use the application with caution and only if they know what they are doing.

2. **Potential damage warning:** The application warns that incorrect commands can damage the system.

3. **Liability disclaimer:** The application makes clear that the user is responsible for their actions and for complying with all applicable laws.

These disclaimers are consistent with industry best practices and with the requirements of the DMCA exemption, which establishes that circumvention must not constitute a violation of applicable laws.

---

## 9. Triennial Renewals and Continued Validity

The DMCA Class 21 exemption has been consistently renewed in each triennial cycle since its initial adoption in 2015:

| **Cycle** | **Year** | **Exemption Status** | **Significant Changes** |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Sixth Cycle | 2015 | Adopted | Initial exemption for vehicle software; excludes telematics and entertainment systems |
| Seventh Cycle | 2018 | Renewed and expanded | Removal of exclusion for telematics and entertainment systems[7] |
| Eighth Cycle | 2021 | Renewed | Confirmation of exemption without substantial changes[8] |
| Ninth Cycle | 2024 | Renewed and expanded | Expansion to include marine vessels and additional agricultural vehicles[8] |

The consistent renewal of the exemption demonstrates the continued recognition by the Librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights that vehicle owners' access to vehicle software is essential for non-infringing uses and does not adversely affect the market for copyrighted works.

The 2024 renewal, the most recent, expanded the exemption to include not only motorized land vehicles but also marine vessels, reflecting the expansion of embedded software in a wider range of vehicles[8]. This expansion underscores the trend toward broader recognition of owners' rights to access the software in products they own.
